Finally, the phoneme probabilities, dynamic parameters, Δ and ΔΔ, and the input MFCCs, combined as hybrid features, are fed into a hidden Markov model (HMM) based classifier to obtain more accurate phoneme strings.

It is difficult to recognize speech affected by gender factors, especially when an ASR system contains only a single acoustic model. If there exists any suppression process that represses the decrease of differences in acoustic-likelihood among categories resulted from gender factors, a robust ASR system can be realized. In this paper, we have proposed a technique of gender effects suppression that composed of two hidden Markov model (HMM)-based classifiers and that focused on a gender factor. In an experiment on Bangla speech database prepared by us, the proposed system has provided a significant improvement of word correct rate, word accuracy and sentence correct rate in comparison with the method that incorporates only a single HMM-based classifier for both male and female speakers."
